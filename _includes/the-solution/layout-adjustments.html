<h2>2.5. Layout Adjustments</h2>

<p>Depending on your screen size, definition, viewing distance and zoom, you increase or reduce the available space and dimensions of your design, your design should adapt to the new constraints. But all the media queries breakpoints are set to the authors settings.</p>

<p>To solve this problem, we need to recalculate the media queries so that the breakpoints continue to be in the same relative point in your design.</p>

<p class="example">Example: Change the settings of the asDesigned component so that it thinks that it has a different size. For example, if you are on a laptop inser the settings for a small screen (3.5" or so) or just insert a higher value for your viewing distance (it also changes the perceived size), all your design will adjust itself.</p>
