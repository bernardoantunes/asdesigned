<h1>About</h1>

This project was created by me, Bernardo Antunes.
You can check my website for other cool projects, notes and ideas.

I am not a designer and I didn't develop for some time.
But I had the idea to have my own website and I could not use just some template or allow somebody to make it for me, it is a personal thing, so it had to be me to do it.

So I enter into a journey that finished with me thinking about the web, patterns, standards, tools, etc., and since I am passionate about anything that I do, I ended creating some interesting tool as the Unit Grid System and this initiative asDesigned.

I have already other ideas and subjects to discuss... to anyone that is interested in making a better world, feel free to contact me! :)
